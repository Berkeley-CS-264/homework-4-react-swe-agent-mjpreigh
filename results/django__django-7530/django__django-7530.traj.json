AS THEY WILL BE USED FOR EVALUATION.\n\n\n----------------------------\n|MESSAGE(role=\"user\", id=8)|\nI will open the makemigrations command implementation to inspect where allow_migrate() is being called with incorrect (app_label, model) pairs. Then I'll modify it to call routers.allow_migrate() with each app's own models rather than all models. Proceeding to open the file. \n----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----\nshow_file\n----ARG----\nfile_path\n----VALUE----\ndjango/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\n----END_FUNCTION_CALL----\n\n----------------------------\n|MESSAGE(role=\"system\", id=9)|\n----------------------------\n|MESSAGE(role=\"system\", id=9)|\n     1\timport io\n     2\timport os\n     3\timport sys\n     4\timport warnings\n     5\tfrom itertools import takewhile\n     6\t\n     7\tfrom django.apps import apps\n     8\tfrom django.conf import settings\n     9\tfrom django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError\n    10\tfrom django.db import DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS, connections, router\n    11\tfrom django.db.migrations import Migration\n    12\tfrom django.db.migrations.autodetector import MigrationAutodetector\n    13\tfrom django.db.migrations.loader import MigrationLoader\n    14\tfrom django.db.migrations.questioner import (\n    15\t    InteractiveMigrationQuestioner, MigrationQuestioner,\n    16\t    NonInteractiveMigrationQuestioner,\n    17\t)\n    18\tfrom django.db.migrations.state import ProjectState\n    19\tfrom django.db.migrations.utils import get_migration_name_timestamp\n    20\tfrom django.db.migrations.writer import MigrationWriter\n    21\tfrom django.utils.deprecation import RemovedInDjango20Warning\n    22\tfrom django.utils.six import iteritems\n    23\tfrom django.utils.six.moves import zip\n    24\t\n    25\t\n    26\tclass Command(BaseCommand):\n    27\t    help = \"Creates new migration(s) for apps.\"\n    28\t\n    29\t    def add_arguments(self, parser):\n    30\t        parser.add_argument(\n    31\t            'args', metavar='app_label', nargs='*',\n    32\t            help='Specify the app label(s) to create migrations for.',\n    33\t        )\n    34\t        parser.add_argument(\n    35\t            '--dry-run', action='store_true', dest='dry_run', default=False,\n    36\t            help=\"Just show what migrations would be made; don't actually write them.\",\n    37\t        )\n    38\t        parser.add_argument(\n    39\t            '--merge', action='store_true', dest='merge', default=False,\n    40\t            help=\"Enable fixing of migration conflicts.\",\n    41\t        )\n    42\t        parser.add_argument(\n    43\t            '--empty', action='store_true', dest='empty', default=False,\n    44\t            help=\"Create an empty migration.\",\n    45\t        )\n    46\t        parser.add_argument(\n    47\t            '--noinput', '--no-input',\n    48\t            action='store_false', dest='interactive', default=True,\n    49\t            help='Tells Django to NOT prompt the user for input of any kind.',\n    50\t        )\n    51\t        parser.add_argument(\n    52\t            '-n', '--name', action='store', dest='name', default=None,\n    53\t            help=\"Use this name for migration file(s).\",\n    54\t        )\n    55\t        parser.add_argument(\n    56\t            '-e', '--exit', action='store_true', dest='exit_code', default=False,\n    57\t            help='Exit with error code 1 if no changes needing migrations are found.

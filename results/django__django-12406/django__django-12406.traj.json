AS THEY WILL BE USED FOR EVALUATION.\n\n\n----------------------------\n|MESSAGE(role=\"user\", id=20)|\nyour_thoughts_here\nI will modify ForeignKey.formfield in django/db/models/fields/related.py to ensure that when a RadioSelect (or subclass) widget is requested for a ForeignKey whose model field has blank=False, the ModelChoiceField is created with empty_label=None. This avoids rendering a blank (\"\" / \"---------\") radio option as a preselected choice for required foreign keys.\n\nI will make a small, localized change: inspect kwargs['widget'] (handling both widget classes and instances), and if it is (or subclasses) forms.RadioSelect and the model field's blank is False, set empty_label=None in the kwargs passed to super().formfield(...).

Only gather deeper context for those candidates, such as their structure, recent change history, and import patterns. After determining the specific file and the minimal code block that needs to be updated, apply targeted edits and generate a minimal, clean patch. Validate your changes with quick syntax and import checks before finalizing. Always aim for the smallest safe diff possible and avoid unnecessary full-repository scans to keep analysis efficient.

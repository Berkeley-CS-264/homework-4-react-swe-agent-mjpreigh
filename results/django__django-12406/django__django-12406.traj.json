AS THEY WILL BE USED FOR EVALUATION.\n\n\n----------------------------\n|MESSAGE(role=\"user\", id=34)|\nyour_thoughts_here\nI'll inspect the related field implementation to find where ModelChoiceField is created for ForeignKey and how empty_label is set. Then I'll make a minimal change so ModelChoiceField receives empty_label=None when the model field has blank=False (so RadioSelect won't render a preselected blank choice). I'll open django/db/models/fields/related.py to find the formfield implementation.\n\n----BEGIN_FUNCTION_CALL----\nshow_file\n----ARG----\nfile_path\n----VALUE----\ndjango/db/models/fields/related.py\n----END_FUNCTION_CALL----\n\n----------------------------\n|MESSAGE(role=\"system\", id=35)|\n----------------------------\n|MESSAGE(role=\"system\", id=35)|\n     1\timport functools\n     2\timport inspect\n     3\tfrom functools import partial\n     4\t\n     5\tfrom django import forms\n     6\tfrom django.apps import apps\n     7\tfrom django.conf import SettingsReference\n     8\tfrom django.core import checks, exceptions\n     9\tfrom django.db import connection, router\n    10\tfrom django.db.backends import utils\n    11\tfrom django.db.models import Q\n    12\tfrom django.db.models.constants import LOOKUP_SEP\n    13\tfrom django.db.models.deletion import CASCADE, SET_DEFAULT, SET_NULL\n    14\tfrom django.db.models.query_utils import PathInfo\n    15\tfrom django.db.models.utils import make_model_tuple\n    16\tfrom django.utils.functional import cached_property\n    17\tfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n    18\t\n    19\tfrom . import Field\n    20\tfrom .mixins import FieldCacheMixin\n    21\tfrom .related_descriptors import (\n    22\t    ForeignKeyDeferredAttribute, ForwardManyToOneDescriptor,\n    23\t    ForwardOneToOneDescriptor, ManyToManyDescriptor,\n    24\t    ReverseManyToOneDescriptor, ReverseOneToOneDescriptor,\n    25\t)\n    26\tfrom .related_lookups import (\n    27\t    RelatedExact, RelatedGreaterThan, RelatedGreaterThanOrEqual, RelatedIn,\n    28\t    RelatedIsNull, RelatedLessThan, RelatedLessThanOrEqual,\n    29\t)\n    30\tfrom .reverse_related import (\n    31\t    ForeignObjectRel, ManyToManyRel, ManyToOneRel, OneToOneRel,\n    32\t)\n    33\t\n    34\tRECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT = 'self'\n    35\t\n    36\t\n    37\tdef resolve_relation(scope_model, relation):\n    38\t    \"\"\"\n    39\t    Transform relation into a model or fully-qualified model string of the form\n    40\t    \"app_label.ModelName\", relative to scope_model.\n    41\t\n    42\t    The relation argument can be:\n    43\t      * RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT, i.e. the string \"self\", in which case\n    44\t        the model argument will be returned.\n    45\t      * A bare model name without an app_label, in which case scope_model's\n    46\t        app_label will be prepended.\n    47\t      * An \"app_label.ModelName\" string.\n    48\t      * A model class, which will be returned unchanged.\n    49\t    \"\"\"\n    50\t    # Check for recursive relations\n    51\t    if relation == RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT:\n    52\t        relation = scope_model\n    53\t\n    54\t    # Look for an \"app.Model\" relation\n    55\t    if isinstance(relation, str):\n    56\t        if \".\" not in relation:\n    57\t            relation = \"%s.%s\" % (scope_model._meta.app_label, relation)\n    58\t\n    59\t    return relation\n    60\t\n    61\t\n    62\tdef lazy_related_operation(function, model, *related_models, **kwargs):\n    63\t    \"\"\"\n    64\t    Schedule `function` to be called once `model` and all `related_models`\n    65\t    have been imported and registered with the app registry. `function` will\n    66\t    be called with the newly-loaded model classes as its positional arguments,\n    67\t    plus any optional keyword arguments.\n    68\t\n    69\t    The `model` argument must be a model class.

The programs you are patching are highly essential, so it is crucial that your patches provide accuracy. When analyzing the repository, optimize performance by starting with fast, high-signal checks to identify a small set of candidate files likely to require modification. Only gather deeper context for those candidates, such as their structure, recent change history, and import patterns. After determining the specific file and the minimal code block that needs to be updated, apply targeted edits and generate a minimal, clean patch. Validate your changes with quick syntax and import checks before finalizing. Always aim for the smallest safe diff possible and avoid unnecessary full-repository scans to keep analysis efficient.

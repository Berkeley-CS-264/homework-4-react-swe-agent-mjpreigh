Modified requests/sessions.py: merge_setting now treats mapping entries with value None as deletions when merging. Committed the change ("Treat None values in merged settings as deletions (e.g. session.headers[...] = None removes header)"). Ran pytest: 35 failed, 83 passed. Failures indicate my change was too broad and affected authentication/cookie behaviors. Recommend narrowing the change to headers-only (or alternative options as described). Awaiting your instruction which option to apply next; I can implement option 1 (headers-only) and re-run tests.

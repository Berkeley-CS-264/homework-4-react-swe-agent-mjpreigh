Update nodes.Node.add_marker to refresh cached xfail evaluation when adding xfail dynamically

When a pytest.mark.xfail(...) is added dynamically to a node (for example via request.node.add_marker),
the node's xfail evaluation cache is refreshed so the running test will be treated as xfailed if the
mark's condition applies. This mirrors the behavior of statically-declared xfail marks.

Change summary:
- src/_pytest/nodes.py: after inserting/appending marker into own_markers, if the marker name is "xfail"
  then import _pytest.skipping.xfailed_key and evaluate_xfail_marks and store the evaluated Xfail result
  in the node's _store under xfailed_key (if present). Exceptions during evaluation are ignored to be
  conservative.

This ensures dynamic xfail additions behave consistently with static xfail marks.

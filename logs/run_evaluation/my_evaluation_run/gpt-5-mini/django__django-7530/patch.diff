Updated makemigrations consistency check to call router.allow_migrate() with models specific to each app.

Change:
- In django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py, the iteration over models for the consistency check now uses:
    for model in apps.get_app_config(app_label).get_models()
  instead of:
    for model in apps.get_models(app_label)

This ensures allow_migrate() is called with valid (app_label, model_name) pairs for each app, avoiding incorrect cross-app model combinations.

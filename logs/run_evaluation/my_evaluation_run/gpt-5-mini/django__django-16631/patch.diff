Clarify SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS semantics in django/conf/global_settings.py

- Updated comment near SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS to explain:
  - That it is a list of previous secret keys for verifying existing signatures.
  - That salted_hmac() uses settings.SECRET_KEY by default and does not consult SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS.
  - That higher-level verification code (e.g. token/session verification) must explicitly attempt verification using values from SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS to preserve validity after rotating SECRET_KEY.
  - Suggested placing most-recent fallbacks first for efficiency when multiple are provided.

This is a minimal documentation change to avoid misleading guidance about automatic fallback behavior.

Added minimal torch.nn.Module stub to doc/source/conf.py to ensure Sphinx shows "Bases: torch.nn.Module" when torch is mocked or absent. If you need the same change applied to a different conf.py path (e.g. docs/conf.py or doc/conf.py), tell me the target and I'll produce the patch for that location.
